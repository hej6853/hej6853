<div align="left">

I’m a Technical Product Manager, passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex business challenges!

🚀 Passionate About Data & Product Management
I thrive in roles where I can apply data analysis, visualization, and interpretation to drive strategic decisions. Whether it's leading the development of Data Science solutions that save millions or optimizing processes to enhance user experiences, I love turning data into actionable business solutions.

💡 Technical Expertise & Continuous Learning
My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Tableau, and more. I've also expanded my expertise through the USC Data Analysis & Visualization Bootcamp, where I honed my data analysis, machine learning, LLM, NLP and visualization skills. I'm always eager to learn and apply the latest tools and techniques.

🌟 Collaborative & Impact-Driven
Collaboration is at the heart of my approach. I enjoy working in dynamic, cross-functional teams to deliver products that make a significant impact. From reducing operational costs to enhancing customer satisfaction, I aim to create value at every step.

🌍 Beyond Work
Outside of my professional life, I’m an avid traveler and hiker who loves learning new languages and cultures. I also enjoy finding the perfect soundtrack for a good book.

🤝 Let's Connect!
If you're looking for someone with a strong product management, data science, and business analysis background, I’d love to connect with you and explore how we can collaborate to achieve great things.
